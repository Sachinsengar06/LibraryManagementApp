## Installation Notes
   - When creating a new project please wait for all dependencies to be restored; "dotnet restore" 
     for asp.net project & "npm install" for angular project. When using VisualStudio this is 
     automatic, check the output window or status bar to know that the package/dependencies restore 
     process is complete before launching your program for the first time.
  - If you get any errors, consider running manually the steps to build the project
    and note where the errors occur. Open command prompt and do the below steps:
    - run 'dotnet restore' from the two project folders - Restore nuget packages
    - run 'npm install' from the project with package.json - Restore npm packages
   Try running the application again - Test to make sure it all works.
